            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Most business and trade references recommend securing the services of an accountant
              and a lawyer on or before actually doing business. A good lawyer or law firm should
              provide you with sound advice and prevent legal liability, which often translates into
              significant savings. On the other hand, when you are, in fact, suing or being sued,
              legal representation is indispensable and urgent.

              The best counsel for you depends primarily on your legal needs. Most lawyers, whether
              practicing on their own or in a firm, should be competent enough to advise you on
              common issues and handle simple cases. Nevertheless, for complex or pervasive legal
              problems or when legal exposure in terms of money increase, it may be wise to consider
              such factors as educational background and attainment, length of period in the
              practice, specialization, manpower and other resources, and pedigree in hiring legal
              representation.

              How important is specialization in hiring a lawyer?
            </summary>
            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Like doctors, lawyers start out as general practitioners, but to develop their
              specialization, they must acquire further education, experience, expertise, or
              exposure in a specific field. Lawyers specializing in a specific field are generally
              preferred and sought after as they employ their significant advantage in education,
              expertise, experience and established networks in servicing their clients.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Most law firms strive to become “full service” or “multi-specialty” firms in order to
              become one-stop shops for their clients. Being a one-stop shop affords significant
              advantages for clients in terms of, among others, convenience, ease of coordination,
              familiarity with the business and its unique concerns, rapport, consistency of quality
              of service, and value for money. Thus, while a multi-specialty firm is a
              jack-of-all-trades, it is also a master of several fields because of the
              specialization of its lawyers.

              Lawyers price their services in a wide range or spectrum, such that, with diligence or
              good referrals, you should be able to find a competent lawyer or law firm within your
              budget. Although exorbitant legal fees are by no means always a guarantee for
              top-notch services, exceptional lawyers and good law firms, knowing the value of their
              services, are able to put a reasonable premium on their fees in exchange for better
              quality of service, speed and efficiency.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              In determining the price or fee rate for their services, lawyers consider many
              factors, including, the difficulty and complexity of your case, how much resources,
              time or manpower the matter will require, the venue of the case, the potential gain or
              exposure for the client, the client’s stature, who referred the client, and whether
              the client is an old or new client. These factors also determine the discounts on fees
              lawyers may afford their preferred clients.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Lawyers and law firms usually charge an acceptance fee upon engagement. Depending on
              the needs of their clients, lawyers and law firms usually employ the following billing
              arrangements: (a) retainer; (b) hourly; (c) per pleading/hearing (or appearance); (d)
              packaged or stage-billing; (e) hourly-capped; (f) contingency or success; or a
              combination of said fee structures.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              An acceptance fee is a fee for accepting a case or a client. It is generally not
              considered a fee for services rendered (or work performed) as these services are, as a
              rule, charged separately. Upon payment, the client is entitled to representation by
              the lawyer or law firm and the assurance that the lawyer or law firm shall not engage
              other clients or espouse other interests that are in conflict with the client’s.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              A retainer fee is usually a monthly fee of a fixed amount for a buffet of advisory and
              other services, including, review of contracts and agreements, drafting of legal
              opinions and other legal documents in the ordinary course of business. Corporate
              housekeeping and corporate secretary services may also be included in such fee. A
              retainer fee does not usually include prosecuting or defending against criminal, civil
              or administrative cases, or those before quasi-judicial agencies (such as the
              Department of Justice and the NLRC), which are billed hourly.

            </summary>
            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Prosecuting or defending against criminal, civil or administrative cases, or those
              before quasi-judicial agencies, commonly referred to as litigation, is typically
              billed by the hour or at an hourly rate. Extensive studies, drafting of lengthy
              opinions, preparation of voluminous documents or submissions requiring considerable
              amounts of time, manpower or effort may also be billed by the hour. The hourly-billing
              arrangement is the customary fee structure employed by lawyers because it is generally
              regarded as the most fair for both the lawyer and the client. This is because the
              amount of fees is directly proportional to the amount of work performed as it is based
              only on the actual time spent on the matter.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Yes, instead of billing by the hour, lawyers may opt to bill by output (a pleading,
              motion or any other document) at a fixed rate that disregards the amount of time
              required to prepare the same. A fixed rate for court appearances or meetings may also
              be agreed upon.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              A packaged or stage-billing arrangement is an alternative (like output billing) to
              hourly billing in that a client is charged a fixed amount for representation in a
              case, usually billed at certain stages of the case. The amount billed may be based on
              the money value of the legal claim prosecuted or defended against, in which case, it
              is sometimes referred to as “value-billing”.

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              An hourly-capped arrangement is a variation of the hourly billing arrangement in that
              a limit or cap, whether in terms of money or time, is agreed upon, such that even if a
              lawyer’s services take more time than expected, the client is not billed over the
              limit or cap

            <p className='text-justify xl:mr-52 text-[#8C760A]'>
              Instead of billing by the hour or per output/appearance, a lawyer may bill a client
              equivalent to a percentage (usually 10% or more) of the amount received by the client
              from an award by a court or tribunal in case of a victory. Note, however, that
              contingency fees are not popular among reputable lawyers as it places a pecuniary
              interest in the outcome of the case and encourages a mercenary attitude among lawyers.
              A success fee is a variation of the contingency fee in that while a lawyer may be
              compensated by the hour or per output, he or she is entitled to collect a fixed fee in
              case of a victory.

              Legal costs and other expenses, include filing fees, telephone call costs, facsimile
              and document reproduction charges, courier fees, hotel and transportation expenses
              incurred in court appearances, cost of stenographic notes, printing of briefs and the
              like, are for the client’s account. Lawyers usually ask for a deposit for
              out-of-pocket expenses to defray these costs. These costs are not fees for
              professional services; rather, they are costs arising from engaging in legal
              processes.
