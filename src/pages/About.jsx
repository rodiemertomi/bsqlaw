            &nbsp; was founded by three law partners, Dickson, Gilbert and Bayan, who worked
            together at a major Makati law firm. After a combined twenty five years of legal
            practice, they decided to establish a law firm, more grounded on their shared values and
            a deeper concern for their clients.
